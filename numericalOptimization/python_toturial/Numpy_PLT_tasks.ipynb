    "## Challenge! Implement a simulation of the N-body problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "The N-body problem is at its core a simple task: we have a number of point-masses, for example planets, stars etc, with a very large mass and very small radius compared to their distance to each other. Gravity will pull each of the planets together and thus they begin to move and orbit each other. A mathematical description of the N-body system is easy, but a simulation is actually hard. \n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity we look at the N-body problem in 2D. Such a system is for example given by the solar system, where most planets nicely sit on plane around the sun and we can just look from above on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a given time t, we model the positions and velocities of then ith planet/star etc as a vector of positions $p_i$ with velocity $v_i$ and mass $m_i$. Since physically, velocity is the derivative of the position wrt time, we can approximate the movement of a planet during time $\\Delta_t$ as $p_i+\\Delta_t v_i$. The true complexity lies in the change of $v_i$ which is defined as its derivative wrt time:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}v_i=G\\sum_{j=1, j\\neq i}^N m_j \\frac{p_j - p_i}{(p_j - p_i)^3+\\epsilon}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $G$ is the gravitational constant, $N$ the number of objects. $\\epsilon>0$ is a number not derived from mathematics but a constant added for numerical reasons, to prevent division by 0 when the distance of $p_i$ and $p_j$ is approximately 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of heaving a vector per planet, we will merge the velocities and positions matrices  $p_t,v_t$ indexed by the current time index $t$, where each row represents one planet. With this, we can simulate the solar system over time as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ v_{t+1}=v_t+\\Delta t \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}v_t$$\n",
    "$$ p_{t+1}=p_t+\\Delta t v_{t+1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that we use $v_{t+1}$ in the second step. This is very important to get a good simulation (the resulting scheme is a so-called symplectiv Euler integration, that aims to keep the total energy of the system constant)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, your task is the following:\n",
    "1. Implement the derivative. Aim to do this without using any loops. For this check \"broadcasting\" in the notes and on the web.\n",
    "   If this is hard at the beginning, try to only use a single loop and remove that one in the second step! implement the norm yourself or use np.linalg.norm\n",
    "2. Implement the symplectic integrator over $T$ steps with a given time step $\\Delta_t$ starting from an initial value for both $p$ and $v$.\n",
    "   Store for each time step the resulting matrices $v_{t+1}$ and $p_{t+1}$ in a 3D array.\n",
    "4. Plot the results! begin by plotting the paths of the objects. compute the average speed of the planets (speed is the norm of $|v_i|$)\n",
    "   and plot the speed of earth and jupyter as function of time. You can also try to plot the velocity vector direction by drawing small arrows along the plotted orbits. For this, look up the docs of matplotlib.pyplot.quiver https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.quiver.html In general use this opportunity to familiarize yourself with more functions in matplotlib. Can you make the plot square so that circles become true circles?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided a reasonable setting for the earth,sun and jupiter system. Aim to simulate the system for 12 years at a resolution of 1h per step. This is the orbit time of jupiter. This system is reasonably simple to compute. Unfortunately the simple integrator we use does not work very well for more complex system. If you are willing to invest more effort and time in it, you can try to simulate the earth-sun-moon system. However, be careful to not shoot the moon out of the solar system :-)\n",
